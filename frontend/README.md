# Neo4j Agentic Chatbot UI

This project is the frontend user interface for the **Neo4j Agentic Chatbot API**. It provides a clean, modern, and responsive chat interface for interacting with the AI agent.

This application was originally cloned from the excellent [ChristophHandschuh/chatbot-ui](https://github.com/ChristophHandschuh/chatbot-ui) repository and has been specifically adapted to connect with the custom agentic backend, display its multi-step reasoning, and handle its rich data responses.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-frontend-repo-url>
    cd <your-frontend-repo-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Connecting to the Backend

For the chat to function, it must be connected to the [Neo4j Agentic Chatbot API](<your-backend-repo-url>).

1.  Ensure the backend server is running, typically on `http://localhost:5000`.
2.  In the root of this frontend project, create a file named `.env.local`.
3.  Add the following line to the `.env.local` file to point the frontend to your local backend server:
    ```
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
    ```
